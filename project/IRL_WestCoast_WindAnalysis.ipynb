    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebooks contains all the analysis carried as part of the project for the 2024 **Programming for Data Analytics (PFDA)** course from the Atlantic Technical University. The project was set up quite open both in terms of the data to be used and the questions to be asked. I have followed the suggestion of downloading the historical wind data from the Met Eireann website (https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data). I had never used wind or weather data in the past (I come from a fisheries data background), and found weather data to be quite interesting as weather patterns can be quite \n",

    "However, I have taken the assessment project a step further by downloading the data from three different weather stations in the West Coast of Ireland. "
