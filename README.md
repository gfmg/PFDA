# 2024 Programming for data analytics :bar_chart: <br/> Guillermo F. Martin Gonzalez
Repository of the "Programming for data analytics" course as part of the Higher Diploma in computing for Data Analytics by Atlantic Technical University (ATU).  All code has been developed by the repository owner: Guillermo F. Martin Gonzalez. Relevant references for external information are appropriately included.</p>

## :sunglasses: Purpose
The objectives of this repository could be summarized:  

1. **Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data**

2. **Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems**

3. **Create software that incorporates and utilizes standard numerical libraries**

4. **Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications**

## :file_folder: Structure
The repository contains the following folders: 

- `assignment`: in this folder you will find the weekly assignments developed over the semester. Four different Jupyter Notebooks can be found here. 

- `project`: this folder will contain the code for the big project to be developed by the end of January 2025  

- `mywork`: folder that contains the code developed as part of the labs, or independent work

## :rocket: Installation and use
You can run and modify the content of this repository by simply cloning the repository from GitHub by copying the url of the repository as: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gfmg/PFDA
cd your-directory
```
Remember, that in order for you to locally update the notebooks you need to `git pull`. **Also important**, you need to have installed `VS Code` (or any other text editor) and `Python` to run the Jupyter notebook. You may also need to install the Python packages outlined in the `requirements.txt` file:        

```bash  
#Two options here: 
python -m pip install package 
pip3.13 install package # Alternative based on your currently installed Python version 
# See here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2812520/dealing-with-multiple-python-versions-and-pip
